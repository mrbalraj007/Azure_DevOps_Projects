##  <span style="color: Yellow;"> Azure DevOps Release Pipelines: Blue-Green Deployment
This section focuses on setting up Azure DevOps release pipelines to automate the deployment process. It explains how to create a release pipeline using the GUI-based editor, configure continuous deployment triggers, and implement deployment gates for additional control. The blue-green deployment strategy is highlighted, showing how to use deployment slots to minimize downtime during deployments.

##  <span style="color: Yellow;"> Azure DevOps Self-Hosted Agents: Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
This section delves into the setup and use of self-hosted agents on Azure VMSS. It compares Microsoft hosted agents with self-hosted agents, explaining the benefits and use cases for each. Detailed steps are provided to set up self-hosted agents on VMSS, register the agents with Azure DevOps, and use them in pipelines. The section also covers the benefits of using VMSS, such as automatic scaling and high availability.

##  <span style="color: Yellow;"> Key Points

## <span style="color: Yellow;">Setting Up the Infrastructure </span>

I have created a Terraform code to set up the entire infrastructure, including the installation of required Software, tools, and the Webapp automatically created.

Below is a terraform Code:

Once you [clone repo](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/04_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_secretsanta-generator)</span> and run the terraform command.
```bash
$ ls -l
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----

-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            615 variable.tf
```

You need to run the following terraform command.

Now, run the following command.
```bash
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply 
# Optional <terraform apply --auto-approve>
```

           - if above script failed then try with this one only  
 `#!/bin/bash apt-get update && apt-get install -y npm`

#### <span style="color: Cyan;"> Step 4: Set Up Agent Pool in Azure DevOps
1. **Project Settings**:
   - Go to the project settings in Azure DevOps.
   - Navigate to the "Agent Pools" section.

   - it will generate the basic structure.

#### <span style="color: Cyan;">  Step 6: Use Self-Hosted Agent in Pipeline

1. **Edit Pipeline**:
   - Edit the existing pipeline to use the newly created self-hosted agent pool.
   - Example:
     - Update the pipeline YAML file to specify the agent pool:
       ```yaml
       pool:
         name: devops-demo_vm
       ```
      - ðŸ‘‰[Complete Pipeline]()ðŸ‘ˆ 

2. **Run Pipeline**:
   - Trigger the pipeline to run using the self-hosted agent.
   - Monitor the pipeline execution to ensure it uses the self-hosted agent.

#### <span style="color: Cyan;">  Step 7: Testing and Debugging
1. **Monitor Agents**:
   - Check the status of the agents in the Azure DevOps agent pool section.
   - Ensure the agents are online and ready to execute pipeline jobs.

2. **Debug Issues**:
   - Use Azure DevOps logs and VMSS monitoring tools to debug and fix any issues.
   - Example: If a pipeline step fails due to missing software, use custom scripts to install the required software on the VMSS.

#### <span style="color: Cyan;">  Step 8: Verify the Artifacts
1. **Verify**:
   - Artficat will be produce once the pipeline executed as below.

<!-- ```sh
To include the agent pool name and agent name in the ./config.sh command, you can use the --pool and --agent options respectively. Hereâ€™s the updated command:

bash
Copy code
./config.sh --url https://dev.azure.com/<organization> \
            --auth PAT \
            --token <your-pat> \
            --pool <agent-pool-name> \
            --agent <agent-name>
Explanation:
--url: The URL of your Azure DevOps organization.
--auth PAT: Specifies that you are using a Personal Access Token for authentication.
--token <your-pat>: Replace <your-pat> with your actual Personal Access Token.
--pool <agent-pool-name>: Replace <agent-pool-name> with the name of the agent pool you want this agent to belong to.
--agent <agent-name>: Replace <agent-name> with the name you want to assign to this agent.

### Advantages of Using This Project
- **Automated Deployment**: The project demonstrates how to automate the deployment process using Azure DevOps release pipelines.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Blue-green deployment strategy ensures minimal downtime during deployments by using deployment slots.
- **Enhanced Control**: Deployment gates provide additional control over the deployment process, ensuring only approved changes are deployed to production.
- **Scalability**: Using Azure App Service and deployment slots allows for easy scaling of the application based on demand.

### Impact of Using This Project
- **Improved Efficiency**: Automating the deployment process saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
- **Increased Reliability**: Deployment gates and blue-green deployment strategies ensure that only tested and approved changes are deployed to production, increasing the reliability of the application.
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Continuous deployment enables faster release cycles, allowing new features and updates to reach users more quickly.
- **Better User Experience**: Reduced downtime during deployments ensures a better user experience, as the application remains available during updates.
    
## <span style="color: Yellow;"> Environment Cleanup:
- As we are using Terraform, we will use the following command to delete 

  - run the terraform command.
```bash
Terraform destroy --auto-approve
```


### Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this project, users can automate their CI/CD processes, improve control over deployments, and ensure reliable and scalable application updates. The use of blue-green deployment and self-hosted agents further enhances the user experience by minimizing downtime and providing greater control and security.
