##  <span style="color: Yellow;"> Key Points

1. **Architecture Overview**:
   - The architecture includes components such as Azure Repos, Azure Storage Account, Build Pipeline, and Release Pipeline.
   - Terraform is used for infrastructure as code, and the state file is stored securely in Azure Storage Account.

2. **Build Pipeline**:
   - The build pipeline includes tasks to build and push a Docker image to Azure Container Registry.
   - Terraform configuration files are published as pipeline artifacts for use in the release pipeline.

3. **Release Pipeline**:
   - The release pipeline is linked to the artifacts published by the build pipeline.
   - It includes stages for deploying resources to Dev and QA environments using Terraform.
   - Auto-scaling and alert configurations are set up for the web app.

4. **Terraform Configuration**:
   - Separate files for providers, variables, and main configuration.
   - Variables are stored securely and referenced in the configuration files.
   - The configuration includes creating an Azure App Service Plan, Web App, Auto Scale settings, and Alerts.

5. **Service Connections**:
   - Azure DevOps service connections are created for authentication with Azure and Docker Registry.


## <span style="color: Yellow;">Setting Up the Infrastructure </span>

I have created a Terraform code to set up the entire infrastructure, including the installation of required applications, tools, and storage automatically created.

### <span style="color: Yellow;"> Virtual Machine creation

First, we'll create the necessary virtual machines using ```terraform``` code. 

Below is a terraform Code:

Once you [clone repo](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/10_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_Terraform_ACR_Storage_WebApp)</span> and run the terraform command.
```bash
$ ls -l
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
dar--l          26/12/24   7:16 PM                pipeline
dar--l          23/12/24   3:38 PM                scripts
-a---l          25/12/24   2:31 PM            600 .gitignore
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM           6571 EC2.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            892 main.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            567 output.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            269 provider.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            223 terraform.tfvars
-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            615 variable.tf
```

You need to run the following terraform command.

Now, run the following command.
```bash
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply 
# Optional <terraform apply --auto-approve>
```
-------

Once you run the terraform command, then we will verify the following things to make sure everything is setup via a terraform.

### <span style="color: Orange;"> Inspect the ```Cloud-Init``` logs</span>: 
Once connected to VM then you can check the status of the ```user_data``` script by inspecting the log files
```bash
# Primary log file for cloud-init
sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
                    or 
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log | more
```
- *If the user_data script runs successfully, you will see output logs and any errors encountered during execution.*
- *If thereâ€™s an error, this log will provide clues about what failed.*

### <span style="color: cyan;"> Verify the Installation 

- [x] <span style="color: brown;"> Docker version
```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-95-197:~$ docker --version
Docker version 24.0.7, build 24.0.7-0ubuntu4.1


docker ps -a
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-25:~$ docker ps
```
- [x] <span style="color: brown;"> kubectl version
```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-97:~$ kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.1
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
```
- [x] <span style="color: brown;"> Azure cli version
```bash
azureuser@devopsdemovm:~$ az version
{
  "azure-cli": "2.67.0",
  "azure-cli-core": "2.67.0",
  "azure-cli-telemetry": "1.1.0",
  "extensions": {}
}
```

###  <span style="color: Yellow;"> Advantages

- **Automation**: The entire deployment process is automated, reducing manual intervention and errors.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling ensures that the application can handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Security**: Storing Terraform state files in Azure Storage Account ensures the security and integrity of the infrastructure state.
- **Flexibility**: The use of variables and separate configuration files allows for easy customization and scalability of the infrastructure.

###  <span style="color: Yellow;"> Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust CI/CD pipeline setup using Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Azure Container Web App. By automating the deployment process, it ensures efficient, scalable, and secure deployment of a Python-based web application. The use of Terraform for infrastructure as code provides flexibility and ease of management, making it a valuable approach for modern cloud-based applications.
