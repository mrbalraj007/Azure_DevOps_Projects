![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b62a8efb-cfd2-47cc-9abf-2f15d805c2e5)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a multi-cloud automation setup using Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Ansible. The goal is to automate the deployment of a .NET application across both AWS and Azure environments. The project is divided into four parts, each focusing on different aspects of the automation process.

## Key Points
- **Azure DevOps** is used for the CI/CD workflow.
- **Terraform** is used to provision infrastructure on AWS and Azure.
- **Ansible** is used for configuration management and application deployment.
- **Remote State File** is stored in Azure Blob Storage to maintain the state of the infrastructure.
- **Self-Hosted Agent** is used to overcome the limitations of ephemeral agents provided by Azure DevOps.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, here are some skills and tools you should be familiar with:

- [x] Need to Create a PAT access Token
- [x] Need to Install extension
  - [AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-vsts-tools) 
  - [Custom-terraform-tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JasonBJohnson.azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform)
  - [Terraform installation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks) 

- [x] [Terraform code](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/13_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_Terraform_Multi-Cloud_Automation/Terraform_Code)<br>
  __Note__: Replace resource names and variables as per your requirement in terraform code
    - Update ```terraform.tfvars```
    - Update token and project name in `selfthost_agentvm.tf`
    - Note: In terraform, whereever you find `xxxxxx` then replace the value accordingly.
- [x] Application Repo:     
    - [x] [multi-cloud-project](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/multi-cloud-project.git)
    

## Tools and Technologies
- **Azure DevOps**: For CI/CD pipeline management.
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure provisioning.
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and application deployment.
- **AWS**: For provisioning EC2 instances.
- **Azure**: For provisioning virtual machines.
- **.NET**: For the application being deployed.
- **Ubuntu**: As the base operating system for the virtual machines.

## <span style="color: Yellow;">Setting Up the Infrastructure </span>

I have created a Terraform code to set up the entire infrastructure, including the installation of required applications, tools, and storage automatically created.

**Note**--> Selfthosted agent vm will take approx 5 to 10 min to install the all required software/packages.

- &rArr; <span style="color: brown;">Virtual machines will be created named as ```"devopsdemovm"```

- &rArr;<span style="color: brown;"> Ansible Install
- &rArr;<span style="color: brown;"> Azure CLI Install
- &rArr;<span style="color: brown;"> Storage Acccount & Blob Setup
- &rArr;<span style="color: brown;"> .Net Installation

First, we'll create the necessary virtual machines using ```terraform``` code. 

  - Below is a terraform Code:

  - Once you [clone repo](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/13_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_Terraform_Multi-Cloud_Automation/Terraform_Code)</span> and run the terraform command.

    ```

- You need to run terraform command.
  - Run the following command.
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform fmt
  terraform validate
  terraform plan
  terraform apply 
  # Optional <terraform apply --auto-approve>
  ```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec2fb16f-d7f5-4de6-9831-b9a64829dc7d)
Once you run the terraform command, then we will verify the following things to make sure everything is setup via a terraform.

### <span style="color: Orange;"> Inspect the ```Cloud-Init``` logs</span>: 
Once connected to VM then you can check the status of the ```user_data``` script by inspecting the log files
```bash
# Primary log file for cloud-init
sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
                    or 
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log | more
```
- *If the user_data script runs successfully, you will see output logs and any errors encountered during execution.*
- *If thereâ€™s an error, this log will provide clues about what failed.*

## <span style="color: red;">  Troubleshooting
- Pipeline failed because I was encountring issue with related to environment and python.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0227731-916e-400e-8606-ce69bddb91e8)

```sh
Based on the error message, it seems there are a few issues:
1. The virtual environment `myenv` is not found.
2. The `python` command is not found.
3. The dynamic inventory file `dynamic_inventory.json` is not being parsed correctly.
```

Additionally, created a `requirements.txt` file in the `/multi-cloud-project/Selfhosted-Ansible` directory to install necessary Python packages.

- Create a new file to list the required Python packages.

```plaintext
azure-storage-blob
ansible
```

<!-- ********
Fix:
Check if the virtual environment (myenv) was actually created. Run the following:
```bash
ls -l myenv
```
If myenv doesn't exist, create it:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```
Then, activate it:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
If you're running this in an Azure DevOps pipeline, make sure the virtual environment path is correct and relative to the working directory.


ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure'

Your Python script fetch_state_file.py is trying to import azure.storage.blob, but the module is missing.
Fix: Install the required module by running:
```bash
pip install azure-storage-blob
```
If using a virtual environment, activate it first:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
``` -->

## <span style="color: Yellow;"> Environment Cleanup:
- As we are using Terraform, we will use the following command to delete `ssh_key`  and `Storage account`.

- Run the terraform command.
  ```bash
  Terraform destroy --auto-approve
  ```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd05ed5e-d3ef-4aac-8519-19037bf8b393)

<!-- - I was getting the below error message while deleting the setup. It is getting failed in deleting `ResourceGroup`

- Run the destroy command and it will delete `ResourceGroup` as well. -->
 

## Challenges
- **Ephemeral Agents**: Using Microsoft-hosted agents posed challenges due to their ephemeral nature, making SSH connections difficult.
- **State Management**: Managing the state file in a multi-cloud environment required careful handling to ensure consistency.
- **Dynamic Inventory**: Creating a dynamic inventory for Ansible to manage instances across both AWS and Azure.

## Benefits
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort and potential errors in deploying and managing infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable to manage more instances or additional cloud providers.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent deployment and configuration across different environments.
- **Learning**: Provides valuable insights into multi-cloud management and automation tools.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of automation in managing multi-cloud environments. By leveraging Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Ansible, we can achieve consistent and scalable deployments across AWS and Azure. The challenges faced during the project provided valuable learning experiences, and the benefits of automation were clearly demonstrated. This setup can be further enhanced with additional features and optimizations in the future.
